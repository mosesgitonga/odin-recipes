    <p>A Hungarian dish resembling goulash (a paprika-based potato stew), but <br>
        without potatoes and using meat instead, often chicken and sometimes veal.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced parsley</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups arrabbiata pasta sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons paprika</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil.<br>
             Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain <br>
             and toss with butter, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Keep <br>
             noodles warm while preparing the chicken. </li>
        <li> Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and <br>
            select Saute function. Add oil, shallots, and garlic; saute until fragrant,<br>
             2 to 3 minutes.<br> Pour in pasta sauce, chicken broth, and red wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add<br> 
            chicken to the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according <br>
            to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 <br>
            minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to <br>
            manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining <br>
            pressure carefully using the quick-release method. </li>
        <li>Place 1/2 cup yogurt in a small bowl. Add in 1/2 cup of sauce, a <br>
            tablespoon at time, to temper the yogurt. Add paprika and blend well.<br>
             Pour yogurt mixture back into the pot. Shred the chicken thighs and serve<br>
              over cooked noodles. Garnish each serving with a dollop of yogurt. </li>

    </ol>
